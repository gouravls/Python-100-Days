Tuples are useful when data needs to remain unchanged. However, they have limited functionality compared to lists. Some of the key operations available for tuples include:

count() function – Counts the occurrences of a specific value.
index() function – Finds the first occurrence of a value.
Slicing – Extracts a portion of the tuple.
len() function – Returns the total number of elements.
